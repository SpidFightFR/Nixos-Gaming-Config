# Nixos-Gaming-Configuration
## What is this ?

It's a configuration designed to tailor a nixos installation for gaming, a lot like SteamOS in my opinion. <br>
It simply launches the main user's session (nixos, remember to change it) and enables steam in big picture mode, perfect for a home-made console. <br>

## Quirks ?

- This config works for me, probably not for you, out of the box. So tweak things to your liking.
- You'll need to put a proper `hardware-configuration.nix` within the root of this folder, generated by `nixos-generate-config`
- Tweak the efi settings accordingly to your pc's config.
- This setup is tweaked for an nvidia-open (although lots of proprietary blobs cuz of nvtop) config, for desktop. If you need to change things, please do.
- For AMD hardware, disable the nvidia.nix config file, remove it from the imports, enable hardware accelerated graphics using the wiki.
